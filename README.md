Exploratory Data Analysis of Zameen.com Listings in Pakistan


This project conducts an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of property listings from Zameen.com, Pakistan's leading real estate portal. The primary objective is to uncover the key factors driving property prices across various cities in Pakistan and to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the real estate market.

Project Highlights:


Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Rigorous handling of missing values, removal of duplicates, and standardization of inconsistent categorical data (e.g., City names, Property Types) using fuzzy matching techniques.


Feature Engineering: Creation of new, insightful features such as 'Age_of_Property' and 'Price_per_SqFt' to enhance analytical depth.

Outlier Detection & Treatment: Application of the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and manage outliers in numerical columns like 'Price' and 'Built in year'.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Visualization of data distributions through histograms and countplots, and comparison of property prices across different categories (cities, property types, bedrooms) using bar plots and violin plots.
Correlation Analysis: Examination of relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

Key Insights & Recommendations: Derivation of precise, measurable insights and SMART recommendations for buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to navigate the Pakistani property market effectively.
